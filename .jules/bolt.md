## 2024-05-23 - [Optimization] Stabilization of Heavy Timeline on High-Frequency Log Updates
**Learning:** The `addLog` function in `StudioPage` was being recreated on every render, and since it was a dependency for `igniteSegment` in `useSonicEngine`, it caused the `Timeline` component to re-render on every log update. Since the app polls for job status and logs frequently, this caused significant unnecessary re-rendering of the entire timeline list.
**Action:** Memoize low-level handlers like `addLog`. For hooks like `useSonicEngine`, use `useRef` to access the latest state (like `timelineSegments`) inside callbacks without adding it to the dependency array, keeping the callback stable. Always wrap heavy list components (like `Timeline`) in `React.memo` when their parent re-renders frequently.
